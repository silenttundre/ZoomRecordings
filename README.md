# ZoomRecordings
Was volunteering to help out a school to automate this.

The functionalities for these Zoom functions:
- delete recording files that are 2MB or less
- download recordings that are 20MB or more to your local directory (zoom2_recordings)
- upload all files from the local directory (zoom2_recordings) to your Google Drive
